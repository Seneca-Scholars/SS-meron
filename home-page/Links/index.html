        <h2>How to create Links in html</h2>
        <p>we can create links using the "a" character. this element has an attribute called "title" whose value is 
            the address of the websites or the webpage the user needs to visit.<br />  Inside the a element is the Text/Link 
        the user clicks on which is commonly reffered to as a <b><em>Link Text</em></b> </p>

        <h2>1. Linking to another website</h2>
        <p> to Link to another website we need to use an <b>Absolute <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr></b>
        which begins with the domain name of the website</p>
        <p><a href="uniform.html">Learn More about Uniform URLs</a></p>

        <h2>2. Linking to other web pages on the same website</h2>
        <p> in orde to link web pages of the same website we need to use something known as <b>Relative Urls</b>
        . <dfn>Relative Urls</dfn> are a shorthand version of absoute Urls that allow as to nagivate between webpages easily</p>

        <p>In order to use those correclty we need to familiarize ourselfs with the concept of how directories/foders are strcutured</p>
        <p>if your are reffering to the home page which is inside the parent or root folder, while being inside one of the child folders
            you use the following path "../parent folder name / index.html"
            <p>for example the following link would take you to the homepage of this website</p>
            <a href="../index.html">Click here to go the homepage</a>
            
        </p>
